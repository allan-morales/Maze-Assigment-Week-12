Assigment - Week 12
Creating the maze in Unity was an exhilarating experience, although it presented some challenges due to the intricacies of managing various layers. At times, I found myself a bit confused, trying to comprehend the different layers I needed to create. However, with perseverance and numerous attempts, I gradually overcame the obstacles and completed the maze successfully.

To construct the maze, I relied on the Sci-Fi Construction Kit (Modular) from the Asset Store. This comprehensive asset package provided me with the necessary tools and resources to bring my maze to life. Its modular nature allowed me to assemble the maze's elements in a flexible and customizable manner. Despite encountering a few errors along the way, I persisted and ultimately achieved my goal.
